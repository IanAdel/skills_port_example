This is an ebook with a short bio, skills portfolio  and some codes for geomorphic processes as a example for a course project.
It is meant to be an example for students to create as part of a course project.

Swiss National Science Foundation Ambizione Lecturer

My research interests lie in understanding the landscape changes caused by recent glacier retreat. My doctoral work was completed at ETH Zürich examining sediment discharge in the Alps and developing numerical models to quantify these processes. Following a Post-Doc at JPL-CalTech, I moved to Université de Lausanne, where I continue to develop numerical models of sediment transport in glacierized regions and examine sediment transport from glaciers in Greenland.

I also am interested in teaching quantitative methods for undergraduate students. This page is a teaching example to help students develop and communicate thier skills as part of a modification to the quantitative circiulum at the Faculty of Geoscience and Environmental Sciences at Université de Lausanne.
