# Example of skills portfolio

We have noticed that some student have difficulty articulating the skill learned in thier coursework, despite being competent in them.
To help students articulate thier skills learned, we are considering implementing a "skill portfolio" where student can present the skills they have learned.
As part of a class project, they would have the option to share this publicly on a webage, like this, for instance for potential future employeres.

Here is an English version of the proposed skills portfolio:
